# 🔢 Generating MNIST digits using GANs
This repo contains code to generate new images of handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of machine learning models that are used to generate new examples of data that are similar to a training dataset. In the case of this notebook, we will use GANs to generate new images of handwritten digits that are similar to the images in the MNIST dataset.

## ❓ What are GANs?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of machine learning model that is used to generate new examples of data that are similar to a training dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network generates new examples of data, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and fake examples.

During training, the generator network tries to create new examples of data that are similar to the training dataset, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the real examples and the fake examples generated by the generator network. Over time, the generator network learns to generate new examples of data that are increasingly similar to the training dataset, while the discriminator network becomes better at distinguishing between real and fake examples.

## 🎨 Results
The notebook generates new images of handwritten digits that are similar to the images in the MNIST dataset. The quality of the generated images will improve as the model trains for more epochs.
